## Features

- Real-time weather data via [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)
- Machine learning-based outfit prediction
- Responsive UI styled with TailwindCSS



---

##  How It Works

1. The user clicks the **"Predict Outfit"** button.
2. The browser fetches weather data from Open-Meteo(using geolocation data that it fetches via HTML5 Geolocation API).
3. A POST request is sent to the Flask backend with:
   - Temperature
   - Humidity
   - Wind speed
   - Precipitation
4. The backend loads a trained `RandomForestClassifier` and label encoder.
5. The model predicts the best outfit based on input.
6. The predicted outfit is displayed on the frontend.
